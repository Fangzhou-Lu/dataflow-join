# dataflow-join
An implementation of Ngo et al's GenericJoin in timely dataflow.

Ngo et al presented a very cool join algorithm, some details of which are described in [a blog post](http://www.frankmcsherry.org/dataflow/relational/join/2015/04/11/genericjoin.html). This text will be replaced with a much better description of what is going on, in the fullness of time.
